Announcing v1.3 of V474
MOOC driver for V474 Quad Power Supply Controller

The V474 is a VME card that controls four power supplies. This driver is built
against MOOC 4.4.

Changes from v1.2:

    - Built against MOOC 4.4.

    - A third argument has been added to the create instance function
      which indicates whether the DAC output should be set to zero
      while the supply is off.

    - Uses VWPP 2.1 for concurrency and is now safely multithreaded.

    - Only builds for 6.4 targets and later.

    - Supports digital alarms.
